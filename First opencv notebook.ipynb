    "This is a super-rough tutorial that should get you up and running with OpenCV as fast as possible. The emphasis is on practical, quick, python-based image analysis and manipulation with pointers to a lot of the gotchas. It's not on principles or theory: if you want that, read a book:-)\n",

    "(I recommend : [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Image-Processing-Analysis-Machine-Vision/dp/1133593607/ref=dp_ob_image_bk] for a thorough and clear image processing base as well as a computer vision intro. I also recommend [http://szeliski.org/Book/] which is clear, vision rather than image processing based, and available online)"
